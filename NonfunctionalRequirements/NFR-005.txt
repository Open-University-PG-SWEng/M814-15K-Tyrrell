REQ-ID:NFR-005
Description: The product/system shall display all valid tickets for upcoming events from the identified customer very fast.
Type: Performance Requirements
Rationale: The product/system must support a proper user expierence based on performance and avoid any delay for displaying the ticket data. 
Fit Criterion: The product/system shall be able to hanlde the display of the tickets under following 4 conditions:
	1. For less load in the system the ticket list should be displayed in less than 1 seconds (Assumption: less load is less than 2000 concurrent users)
	2. For normal load in the system the ticket list should be displayed in less than 3 seconds (Assupmtion: normal load is about 10 000 concurrent users)
	3. For high load in the system the ticket list should be displayed in less than 4 seconds (Assupmtion: high load is about 15 000 concurrent users)
	4. For overload in the system the product shall behave based on the defined error handling scenario.  
For cases 1 - 3 the time for displaying the data should be met in 90% of the requests. The number of request should be 5% from the according concurrent users.

Comments: [Frederic Hesse] NFR-005 is associated with functional requirement REQ-ID 011
[ZV] Shouldn't this req. be a more general performance req? "The product/system shall display all data lists very quickly."
[Anthony Albertyn] This has the same intent as NFR-001 although NFR-005 is more narrowly focused. Also, 1 second (even if the list was cached) seems amazingly fast.
[M814 group] NFR-005: accepted, but need rewrite; rejected by the quality gateway
[Frederic Hesse] Based on the feedback of the group I've changed the rationale and fit criterion.
