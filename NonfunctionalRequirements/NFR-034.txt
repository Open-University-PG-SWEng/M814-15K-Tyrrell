REQ-ID: NFR-034
Description: Tickets returned for full events shall not be made available for general sale
Type: security
Rationale: When a ticket for a full event is returned there must be no way that a new purchase can be made against that ticket
Fit Criterion: 100% of tickets identified as belonging to 'full' events shall be transfered to the ticket re-allocation list and not the available for sale list
Originator: Geoff Riley
Comments: [GR] Non-function requirement based on functional requirement REQ-ID: 034
[Frederic Hesse] That tickets are stored in a different list is from my perspective a functional requirement. I don't see the security part of this requirement.
A possible security requirement could be: It has to be ensured that the identification characteristics of the returned tickets (like barcode, QR-code,...) are made invalid and can't be reused.
[Stephen Hynes] The fit criterion does not make clear to me the security 'aspect' (MRP, p.262) or the 'kind' of security requirement (Firesmith, 2003) that is being quantified/measured?  This will aid design of acceptance tests.
