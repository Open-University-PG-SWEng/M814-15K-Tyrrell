REQ-ID:NFR-010
Description: Terms and Conditions shall be written in many languages not only English
Type: Non-Functional (Cultural and Political)
Rationale: It is expected that the tickets will be requested worldwide.
Fit Criterion: The JustTheTicket quality assurance team will inspect and verify that T&C translations are certified translations, made by companies that offer qualified professional translation services. 
Originator: Edna Everage
Comments: [Claudia Sayago] NFR-010 is associated with Functional REQ-ID 016
[Roman Töngi] Shouldn't there be a general requirement for multilingualism so that it needn't be repeated for various requirements?
Comments: [Peter Rogerson] Perhaps the fit criterion should reference specific accreditation to qualify as an expert and name the verification and inspection procedures to be used by JustTheTicket.
[CS]I I think that we don’t have to take for granted that developers will take into account a generalisation regarding languages and therefore they will include T&C in different languages. From my point of view it is necessary to let the developers know that they must do it. 
[CS] maybe the fit criterion should specify the frequency of verification and inspection procedures. Regarding the language professional, they must understand the legal implication of the accuracy of the translation.
[M814 Group] NFR-010: accepted, but fit criterion needs rework and therefore this NFR will be requested for now
[CS]fit criterion has been changed after review comments and the discussion held on the tutorial
