REQ-ID: NFR-001
Description: The product shall support many concurrent users.
Type: Non-functional (performance)
Rationale: The product performance must not degrade during busy times to avoid functionality and transactions from been disrupted or failing.
Fit Criterion: The product shall support at least 10,000 concurrent users, although support for 15,000 concurrent users is preferred.

Comments: [Anthony Albertyn] NFR-001 is associated with functional requirement REQ-ID 010.
[Alvaro Ortiz] 10,000 or 15,000 concurrent users? Perhaps 95% performance with 10k users, 80% performance with 15k users? 
[Anthony Albertyn] I agree that the fit criterion should also specify performance level. My intention was no loss of performance for 10,000 to 15,000 users, but some loss in performance should probably be considered.
[Andrew Stevens] Not sure if it's too granular but when talking about 95% performance - 95% of what? Should the fit criterion also include something along the lines of "a page in the application should load start to finish including dependencies in less than 2 seconds with a load of 5,000 users. With a load of 5,001 to 10,000 users, 5% performance degradation is acceptable, meaning load time should be less than 2.1 seconds. With a load of 10,001 to 15,000 users 20% performance degradation is acceptable, meaning load time should be < 2.4 seconds".
