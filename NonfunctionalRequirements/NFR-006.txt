[SL] This NFR relates to REQ-ID:013
[Kathrin Wuensch:] I am not sure if this equirement is a non-functional requirement as it does not describe how well the system is doing the related functional requirement (that is, REQ-013), but it does describe a new functionality of the system. 
[Stephen Hynes]  The fit criterion reads as more an action than a measure - I need a measure to ensure my test meets or is within a measure.  As written the 'duration' could be days.
[SL] The NFR has been amended as per the quality gateway feedback and re-presented here for review.  
[Manuel Galiu] I also see this requirement as being functional, and not non-functional. Also the fit criterion should try to quantify in a testable way the requirement. Maybe it should validate the input and output number of tickets returned against the business rule defined by the reallocation programme.
