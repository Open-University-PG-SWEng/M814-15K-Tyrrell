REQ-ID: NFR-002
Description: The system shall not impact user experience in order to record purchase events.
Type: Performance (12)
Rationale: User experience should not be affected by a process whose outcome does not affect the user. If it can be made parallel or asynchronous, it should.
Fit Criterion: The recording of purchase events will add zero delay to the user experience.

Comments: [Ziga Vurkeljc] NFR-002 is associated with functional requirement REQ-ID 006.
[Alvaro Ortiz] Seems like a good requirement to me, but I'm not sure how I would design a test to measure the flow. How is flow different from processing time?
[ZV] Modified the Fit criterion, to be clearer. I hope.
[SL] I think its best to be a little more precise with the measure Ziga. May I suggest something like the performance will not fall below 90% of target levels during the recording of events. 
[ZV] Well, in terms of precision I denoted zero. As in it will NEVER impact, not in 90% of cases or 99%, never. Granted that may be a bit too restrictive, but it certainly isn't imprecise.
[SL] I meant to say be less precise Ziga. Adding a margin of tolerance is more likely to avoid other unforeseen factors that could impact your zero tolerant measure and distort what you are trying to achieve, that is to identify an intolerable drop in performance when the purchase data is being recorded. Its just a suggestion.
