REQ-ID: NFR-002
Description: The system shall not impact user experience in order to record purchase events.
Type: Performance (12)
Rationale: User experience should not be affected by a process whose outcome does not affect the user. If it can be made parallel or asynchronous, it should.
Fit Criterion: The recording of purchase events will add zero delay to the user experience.

Comments: [Ziga Vurkeljc] NFR-002 is associated with functional requirement REQ-ID 006.
[Alvaro Ortiz] Seems like a good requirement to me, but I'm not sure how I would design a test to measure the flow. How is flow different from processing time?
[ZV] Modified the Fit criterion, to be clearer. I hope.
[SL] I think its best to be a little more precise with the measure Ziga. May I suggest something like the performance will not fall below 90% of target levels during the recording of events.
