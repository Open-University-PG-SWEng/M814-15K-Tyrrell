Description: The page for buying tickets must open quickly.
Type: Performance

Fit Criterion: Opening the page for buying new tickets may not take longer than 2 seconds. 
Originator: Barry McKenzie
Comments: [Ansgar Goeb] This non-functional requirement is associated with functional requirement REQ-032
[Kathrin Wuensch] This performance requirement is similar to NRF-005 (display a list of upcoming events quickly). The fit criteria should also include a measurement to address the demand on the system (such as: while there are 10 000 concurrent users as , for instance stated in NFR-001) to allow a realistic measurment. Furthermore, allowing some range can make the requirement more flexible for any constraints, such as budget constraints.
[Anthony Albertyn] Fit criteria can be improved by rewording it to: When there are between 5,000 and 10,000 concurrent users, the page load time for the 'buy new tickets page' on a desktop pc, should be between 2 and 4 seconds for 95% of the time.
