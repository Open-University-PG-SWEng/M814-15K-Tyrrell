Comments: [Manuel Galiu] This non-functional requirement is associated with functional requirement REQ-033
[Frederic Hesse] From my understanding this sounds like a functional requirement similar to REQ-011 and NFR-005. Additionaly, in performance requirements there should be something like ranges, e.g. in 95% of the cancelations it should not take longer than 5 minutes. This avoid gold plating.
