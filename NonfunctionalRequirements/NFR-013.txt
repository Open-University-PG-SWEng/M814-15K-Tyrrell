REQ-ID: NFR-013
Description: The system should display all tickets available for cancellation of the return
Type: Performance
Rationale: The user who returned a ticket can realise it made a mistake in returning the ticket. The system should allow him to return any ticket still not reallocated. 
Fit Criterion: On a page all the available tickets are visible. The cancelation process shoudn't take more than 5 minutes.
Originator: Barry McKenzie
Comments: [Manuel Galiu] This non-functional requirement is associated with functional requirement REQ-033
[Frederic Hesse] From my understanding this sounds like a functional requirement similar to REQ-011 and NFR-005. Additionaly, in performance requirements there should be something like ranges, e.g. in 95% of the cancelations it should not take longer than 5 minutes. This avoid gold plating.
[Kathrin Wuensch] I agree wit the comment from Frederic. This is not a non-functional, but a functional requirement. 
[Anthony Albertyn] The description and rational describes a functional requirement, not a non-functional requirement, and the fit criteria quantification does not measure the success if this requirement. To me the fit criteria describes a non-functional usability requirement. ie the description and fit criteria do not relate to each other. Suggestion is to remove this from the non-functional requirements list. If the description was "A user should find it easy to cancel a ticket" then a fit criteria could be: 90-95% of a panel representative of a member of the public should on first attempt be able to cancel two to three tickets within 5 minutes.
