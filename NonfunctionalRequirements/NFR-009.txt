Comments: [M814-ModuleChair] Add comments below, making sure to include your initials in [] at the start.
[Rob McKay] This is a requirement directly from the customer.
[CS] Is there any difference between this requirement and NFR-001? To me both of them look the same.
[Ansgar Goeb] Is it a new requirement (couldn't find the original req)? I think it’s absolutely worth to have an extra requirement for requesting tickets. But I think ‘request a ticket’ should be defined. Is it a request to the available tickets? Or is it the ‘buying of a ticket’? I think especially the latter is worth to define as an extra requirement because an adjacent systems (credit card) is used. This could be the source of a performance problem.
