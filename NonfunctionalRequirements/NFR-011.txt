Comments: [Roman Töngi] This non-functional requirement is associated with functional requirement REQ-009.
[Ansgar Goeb] I think the fit criterion is quite good. I was wondering if not something should be said about the load of the system. Usually it’s easy to fulfil performance goals when the system is idle. I was thinking on something like ‘while at least 10.000 users are connected to the system buying tickets’.
