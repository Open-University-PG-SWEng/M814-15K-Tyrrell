REQ-ID: NFR-014
Description: Returning a sub set of purchased tickets will be intuitive.   
Type: 11. Usability and Humanity Requirements
Rationale: To prevent customers resorting to selling excess tickets on the black market, the return of part purchases should be as simple as possible.     
Fit Criterion:  On first attempt > 95% of customers returning part ticket returns will succeed in less than 5 mins.

Comments: [Peter Rogerson] The fit criterion doesn't reflect the need to be "as intuitive" as returning a full set of tickets. It may also conflict with any requirements relating to returning a full set of tickets, or at least it will determine the length of time for that activity. Would a fit criterion such as "the average time taken to return a set subset of tickets should not take more that 5% longer than the average time to return a full set" be less restrictive and be more reflective of a comparison?
[GR] The rationale is somewhat tortuous to read: perhaps switching it around would help it to read more naturally. For example: "To prevent customers resorting to selling excess tickets on the black market, the returning of part purchases should be as simple as possible."

Description update comment - agree fit criterion does not match description - updated description to remove association with requirement for returning full set of tickets.  There may be an opportunity here to merge 2 FR into one generic FR of returning tickets where any number/sequence of tickets can be returned.
Rationale update comment - agree with quality gateway feedback - switched sentence around as it places intent of 'prevent' at beginning of sentence.
